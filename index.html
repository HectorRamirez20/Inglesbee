                    Bees play a fundamental role in ecosystems and agriculture since they are key pollinators for many plants. However, in recent decades there has been concern about the decline in bee populations due to various factors such as climate change, use of pesticides and the loss of natural habitats. 
                    <br><br>
                    Given this situation, it is important to understand the consequences of the extinction of bees
                    <br><br>
                    Bees are part of the biodiversity on which we all depend for survival. They provide high-quality food -honey, royal jelly and pollen- and other products such as beeswax, propolis and bee venom.
                    <br><br>
                    Bees are extremely social insects that live in colonies that are established in the form of swarms and in which they are organized in a strict hierarchy of three social ranks: the queen bee, the drones and the worker bees.

                    Bees play a crucial role in pollinating plants, which contributes greatly to the success of agriculture. However, recent years have seen a worrying decline in bee populations worldwide. This phenomenon raises serious concerns about the impact that bee extinction will have on agriculture and food security. This research will look at how the extinction of bees would affect agriculture and the possible consequences for humanity.
                    <br><br>
                    Decreased agricultural production: Lack of proper pollination due to bee scarcity would result in fewer fruits and vegetables. Pollination-dependent crops, such as apples, pears, tomatoes, cucumbers and pumpkins, will be particularly affected. Lower agricultural production would lead to food shortages and higher prices, which would have serious implications for global food security.
                    <br><br>
                    Economic impact: The extinction of bees will have a significant economic impact on agriculture and related industries. Beekeepers would suffer massive losses, as honey production would be severely affected. In addition, farmers who depend on pollination of their crops tend to.

                    The extinction of bees would have a significant impact on the food chain and ecosystems in general. Bees play a crucial role in pollination, which is the process of transferring pollen from the male flowers to the female reproductive organs of the flowers, allowing for fertilization and the formation of fruits and seeds. Approximately 75% of food crops depend on pollination by insects, mainly bees.
                    <br><br>
                    Without bee pollination, many plants, including a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and nuts, would be unable to reproduce and would produce fewer or no fruits at all. This would lead to a decrease in food availability and a reduction in diversity in our diet. Furthermore, many animals that depend on these plants as a food source would also be affected.
                    <br><br>
                    The disappearance of bees would also have negative consequences for the food chain at other trophic levels. Bees are an important food source for various animals, such as birds, bats, and other insects. If the bees disappear, these animals would lose a key source of food, which could affect their survival and cause an imbalance in the ecosystems.

                    On our planet there are 1.4 billion insects for every person and, according to David MacNeal in his book Bugged, we need each and every one of these "world drivers" to maintain the balance of ecosystems. However, more than a third of all insect species that inhabit our planet are in danger of extinction, according to the report of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).
                    <br><br>
                    There are at least 20,000 species of wild bees on the planet and, if we go closer to Europe, about 2,500. The pollination carried out by these insects is the natural process that allows the flowers to be fertilized to give seeds and fruits; that is, the cornerstone of biodiversity. But also our food security: globally, a third of food depends on bees, as well as 90% of wild flowering plants, according to the United Nations Food Organization (FAO).
                    <br><br>
                    At a European level, 37% of bee populations are in decline and up to 70% of the crops produced in Spain also depend on pollination, according to Greenpeace data.

                    One of the best things you can do to help bees in your neighborhood is to plant wildflowers that are native to your region. Native wildflowers are especially suited to feeding pollinators that have evolved along with them. 
                    <br><br>
                    This means that instead of living in a large hive like honey bees do, most nesting bees are working single mothers who provide nectar and pollen for a few eggs at a time. 
                    <br><br>
                    Create a pesticide-free environment Pesticides, herbicides and fungicides are all bad news for bees. Pesticides come in many forms and some, such as neonicotinoids, are systemic, meaning they make all parts of the plant (including nectar and pollen) toxic to bees. 
                    <br><br>
                    To avoid harming bees in this way, avoid spraying pesticides; Or if you need to control more species of pest insects, use organic or biological control agents.
